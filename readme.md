Simple application built using Node that makes blog posts.

I have used an array to simplify things and has no database connectivity at all

Navigating through the repo: 

Views 
    /partial - contains all the partial files required 

    Dashboard.ejs - the place where all the posts are being loaded 
    Edit.ejs - Contains a form that allows user to either edit or delete a post
    createnewPost.ejs- Form to let a user enter a post.

index.js -- entry point to the application


To get all the depedencies - npm install
